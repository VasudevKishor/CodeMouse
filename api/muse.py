Instructions:
1. Analyze the provided code snippet to understand its core purpose and logic.
2. Do NOT explain the original code.
3. Generate 3 to 4 alternative implementations.
4. Each implementation must use a different programming paradigm or a distinct, idiomatic language feature (e.g., list comprehension, functional, recursive, library-specific).
5. For each version, provide a short, one-line `# comment` above the code explaining the approach.
6. The output must ONLY be the code snippets with their comments, formatted correctly for the source language. Do not add any conversational text or introductions."""
